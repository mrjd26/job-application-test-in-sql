I'm provided a db with 364756 rows of bike share data in Q1 of 2012 in Washington, D.C.

(example .csv in github has first 100 rows)

I'm tasked with...

"determine what was the longest amount of time a single bike has gone without being ridden between rides. 
Provide the bike_number and the amount of time between rides "

It's a code test for a company I applied to online
